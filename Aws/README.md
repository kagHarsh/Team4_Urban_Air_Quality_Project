# Urban Air Quality Risk Prediction App

This project is a web-based application for predicting urban air quality and health risks based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. The app utilizes machine learning models to provide risk predictions and insights.

## Folder Structure

- **app.py**: The main backend file that runs the Flask server.
- **templates/**: This folder contains the HTML files for the app:
  - `home.html`: The homepage with navigation options.
  - `analysis.html`: Displays data analysis results.
  - `predict.html`: The form for inputting environmental data and displaying predictions.

## Setup Instructions
